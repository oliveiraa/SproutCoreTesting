This is a very simple project created to test how well SproutCore 2.0 can be integrated with ASP.NET MVC

The goal is to compare how easy and flexible SproutCore 2.0 is to create web apps using ASP.NET MVC as a backend.

I am learning SproutCore on the process, so the code here has a really high chance of being not what it should. But hey, that's learning right :)
